Hardware-effective Approaches for Skill Extraction in Job Offers and Resumes	Talk	sheffield	NLP Seminars, University of Sheffield	2024-12-12	Online	N/A	This talk will present hardware-effective methods for skill extraction. In this task, resource optimization is often not a priority, and methods evaluation is limited to job offers due to the challenges of data privacy. We will understand the trade-off between task performance and computing resources, from rule-based systems to BERT-based large language models in both scenarios, resumes, and job offers. Our results show that competitive skill matching can be achieved using minimal hardware, where rule-based and semantic systems run solely in CPU and neural models use minimal GPUs, with less than 25 minutes of training time (1 node, 24GB GPU RAM).

Navigating Skills Detection and Bias in AI-Enhanced HR Systems	Talk	hesso	9th AI Valais/Wallis Workshop on Human-AI Teaming, Swiss Digital Center	2024-04-26	Sierre, Switzerland	https://www.hevs.ch/en/events/9th-ai-valais-wallis-workshop-on-human-ai-teaming-208987	In recent years, the automation of skills detection has gained importance given to the speed of the job market with hundreds of applications per job offer. This task has mainly focused on extracting keywords from job offers using state-of-the-art resource-intensive methods and considerable amounts of annotated data, without a significant consideration of diverse human factors. In this talk, we will focus on the use of AI in Human Resources Systems, specifically in recruiting. We will dive into the existing methods from a research perspective and explore the challenges faced when this task is performed in a one-size-fits-all manner within multiple contexts differing in domains and languages, including potential human and machine bias.
