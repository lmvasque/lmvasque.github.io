title: "PATHWAYS ANALYZER: Design of a Tool for the Synthetic Assembly of Escherichia Coli K-12 MG1655 Bacteria for Biofuel Production."
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2019-05-19-pathways
excerpt: 'The present work aims to design a tool for the transformation of metabolic pathways and the development of path finding algorithms that establish relevant links between compounds that are essential to the biofuel production process. As a result, a catalog of biobricks is created from the analysis of a subset of paths which can be used in the design stage of the synthetic assembly of the E. coli bacteria. The assembly’s structure and functions are characterized according to the pieces used. Finally, new constructions are visualized with the goal of demonstrating and supporting the analysis processes, thus assisting people that work in the field of Synthetic Biology.'
