In recent years, the automation of skills detection has gained importance given to the speed of the job market with hundreds of applications per job offer. This task has mainly focused on extracting keywords from job offers using state-of-the-art resource-intensive methods and considerable amounts of annotated data, without a significant consideration of diverse human factors. In this talk, we will focus on the use of AI in Human Resources Systems, specifically in recruiting. We will dive into the existing methods from a research perspective and explore the challenges faced when this task is performed in a one-size-fits-all manner within multiple contexts differing in domains and languages, including potential human and machine bias.
